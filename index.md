## About
I am a PhD student in computer science at Tufts University, where I am advised
by Dr. Kathleen Fisher. My research interests are in programming languages and 
formal verification. My current research involves using interactive theorem proving 
tools to verify parser generators and other components of PL and data-processing 
infrastructure.

## Publications
Sam Lasser, Chris Casinghino, Kathleen Fisher, and Cody Roux. "A Verified LL(1) Parser Generator." To appear at Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP) 2019.
