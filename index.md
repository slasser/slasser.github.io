## About
I am a PhD student in computer science at Tufts University, where I am advised
by Dr. Kathleen Fisher. My research interests are in programming languages and 
formal methods. My current research involves using interactive theorem proving 
tools to verify parser generators and other components of PL and data-processing 
infrastructure.

Before starting my PhD, I spent several years in industry as a researcher and software
engineer, working on projects related to natural language processing, probabilistic
programming, and cybersecurity.
